         </p>

         <h2>List of Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Three Eggs. <em>This amount can be altered but I find three to be the right amount.</em></li>
            <li>Choice of Protein. <em>I usually opt for turkey breast but bacon and other proteins can definetly be used.</em></li>
            <li>A quarter of an onion.</li>
            <li> A whole Potato. <em>The type of potato is not important</em></li>
            <li>Avocado or olive oil.</li>
            <li>Cajun seasoning.</li>
            <li>Green onions <em>optional</em>.</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li><p>Start off by dicing a whole potato into cube sized pieces. I usually cut it in half to begin with. Make sure your potato is properly
                washed.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>After dicing your potato, toss into a bowl of ice water in order to remove the starch so they don't stick to each other for 3 minutes.
                Drain the water and place the bowl into a microwave for five minutes on high.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>While the potatos are in the microwave, dice the onion into small pieces and set aside. Do the same with your choice of protein.</p></li>
            <li><p>Once your potatos are done. Heat a cast iron skillet with a 3 tablespoons of oil on medium high heat. Once hot enough, empty the bowl of potatos into the skillet
                making sure to separate any potatos stuck together. Let the potatos cook for 3 minutes.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Once the potatos start to brown, toss in your chopped onion and your protein. Stir around to allow proper browning.</p></li>
            <li><p>When your onion becomes translucent and your protein is cooked to your liking, crack three eggs into the pan. Season with cajun seasoning to liking.
                You can choose to scramble them or leave them be for an over easy cook. Allow to cook for 1-2 minutes.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Serve on plate and garnish with green onion.</p></li>
            <li><p>Enjoy!</p></li>
         </ol>
